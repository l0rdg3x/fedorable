## What's all this then?

Fedorable is a personal script I created to help with post install tasks such as tweaks and software installs. It's written in Bash and utilises Dialog for a friendlier menu system. 

It is fully customisable by the user by either editing the script itself or changing the package selections within the flatpak-packages.txt or dnf-packages.txt files.

Dialog must be installed for the menu system to work and as such the script will check to see if Dialog is installed. If not, it will ask you to install it.

Scripts for Cinnamon and KDE will become available in the future.

## Usage
1. Set the script to be executable `chmod -x fedorable.sh`
2. Run the script `./fedorable.sh`
3. Enter user password when required (for installation of packages)
